function [ H ] = est_homography(video_pts, logo_pts)
% est_homography estimates the homography to transform each of the
% video_pts into the logo_pts
% Inputs:
%     video_pts: a 4x2 matrix of corner points in the video
%     logo_pts: a 4x2 matrix of logo points that correspond to video_pts
% Outputs:
%     H: a 3x3 homography matrix such that logo_pts ~ H*video_pts
