function [ f, pos ] = compute_f_pos( d1_ref, d2_ref, H1, H2, ratio, f_ref )
%% Compute camera focal length and camera position to achieve centain ratio between objects
%
% In this function, we focus on two objects: object A with height H1 and
% d1_ref as distance to camera in 3D world, object B with height H2 and
% d2_ref as distance to camera in 3D world.
% We will keep the size of object A in image the same as before while
% adjusting the size of object B in image.
%
% Input:
% - d1_ref: distance of the first object
% - d2_ref: distance of the second object
% - H1: height of the first object in physical world
% - H2: height of the second object in physical world
% - ratio: ratio between two objects in image coordinate (h1/h2)
% - f_ref: 1 by 1 double, previous camera focal length
% Output:
% - f: 1 by 1, camera focal length
% - pos: 1 by 1, camera position on z axis
